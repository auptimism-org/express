# Why is it important?
Now taking this into context with 3 highlight factors of:
* The increase in COVID-19 cases in every country made it impossible for physical therapies to take place even if it is with utmost precautions.
* In India, every 23 child out of 10,000 born having ASD it becomes very important to make sure that everybody is offered the same treatment because it is a question of the youth who are believed to be the future citizens.
* With high prices of a single therapy session and also lack of accessibility to these specialists, it becomes the hour of the need to connect parents and their peers to the ight therapist who could treat their child.
We framed the problem statement of **How can Art Therapy be made easily accessible and help in connecting therapists and children with Autism during these tough times?** 

## Express ##
Express is a paint application which is made specifically for children with Autism under the ambit of Art Therapy.

> Parental Perspective
>> As we are familiar with submitting art and drawing for competitions this follows a same format, where you open a new project and allow the child to experiment with all their creative skills through a set of colors and a brush. With a user friendly interface it could be very easy and knowledgeable for the child to get used to this application. Once the drawing/art is completed the parent just needs to submit it.
On the other hand, we are even giving an option to capture a picture of existing or already made drawings on papers. They just need to select and submit it. And this puts an end to the task of the parent.
> Doctor's Perspective:
>> The doctor logs in to the app as well, through a unique generated user code and find all the submissions in the welcome page by children that come under his provision. That is not it. Express has a unique feature where the doctor also receives a full fledged report on the drawing.
This includes a complete image processed analysis of the percentage of every color used showing the statistics of the color proportions. In addition to this it provides a complete timeline of the entire artwork. With the physical Art Therapies the doctor usually sees the end version of the drawing but here, with it's continuous screen capturing method, the doctor could just move a slider and see the artwork rightn from the first point of the color to the end version.
## Working
Once the artwork has been submitted follwing the steps mentioned in Parental Perspectives, the image shall be processed using technologies such as Computer Vision and Color extraction. In which, the colors in the artwork are extracted and are put in a statistical manner in the form of pie charts and histograms. With most of the things happening in the back-end, our efforts are on reducing the time span for the prcoessing to take place and provide accurate and reliable results.
These statistics will be put in the form of a report with again a user friendly interface. So that it is very easy to interpret the data provided and for easier understanding.

## Future Plans
Since we are currently dealing with a very small segment of Autism because not a lot of children go through Art Therapy, we wish to act small and think big. Which also means if non-verbal communication could be dealt with, which enables us to even deal with mute people or anyone who do actually express themselves either through writing or drawing.
In the future we also wish to include an aspect of education, by providing Express as a platform to learn through Machine Learning Algorithms and Convolution Neural Networks.
